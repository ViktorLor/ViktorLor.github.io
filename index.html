        <h2>Programming Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Digital Election Platform for the JKU Senate Elections</strong>
                <br>Developed a robust and secure digital voting platform to facilitate the JKU Senate Elections,
                significantly enhancing democratic participation among faculty members. Built using Laravel, the system
                leveraged a structured SQL database to securely store voter data, election information, and results. My
                role involved active collaboration within an agile Kanban team, managing task distribution, feature
                development, and rigorous testing cycles. Secure platform enhancing democratic participation. The
                project is not publicly available due to security concerns.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>OCR Workflow Automation Tool</strong>
                <br> Developed a private project focused on automating document processing workflows for auditors using
                advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. This solution significantly accelerates data
                extraction and verification processes, dramatically reducing the time auditors typically spend on manual
                data entry and validation tasks. By converting complex financial documents and invoices into structured
                digital data, the tool enhances accuracy and minimizes human errors. The project's primary goal is to
                optimize accounting procedures, enabling auditors and financial professionals to save hours of tedious
                manual work, thus increasing productivity and allowing them to focus on higher-value analytical tasks.
                The tool is available for commercial usage upon request.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>SEC-Filing Scraper</strong>
                <br>Developed a private project aimed at automating the retrieval and analysis of SEC filings. Utilizing
                advanced scraping and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this tool extracts critical
                financial data from regulatory documents such as 10-K and 10-Q reports. By streamlining the data
                collection and analysis process, the tool significantly reduces the manual effort traditionally required
                for regulatory compliance and investment analysis. The primary objective is to enhance accuracy, improve
                efficiency, and allow financial analysts and compliance professionals to focus on strategic
                decision-making tasks. The scraper is publicly on <a

            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>ROAR RemOve And Retrain – Evaluating AI Model Interpretability</strong>
                <br>Developed a scientific research project focused on evaluating and interpreting AI model
                explainability algorithms using the Remove and Retrain (ROAR) methodology. Leveraging deep learning
                techniques, this project systematically assesses the reliability and accuracy of feature attribution
                methods, providing critical insights into AI model behaviors. The primary objective is to enhance
                transparency and trust in AI systems, aiding researchers and practitioners in making informed decisions
                about model deployment. This work highlights my expertise in scientific analysis and advanced deep
                learning concepts. The complete project is publicly available on <a
